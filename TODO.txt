bugs:
* pause doesn't stop animations
* sound sometimes causes crashes (no idea what this is about, investigate...)

high:
* add a more interesting level environment
 * do some research on what is actually possible
 * design (should have usable reflections)
 * impl geometry (distance function)
 * animations (maybe)
 * add interesting materials/textures

medium:
* make a more interesting pickup shape
* settings screen
 * resolution
 * sound volume
* "static" lights
* effects when taking pickups

low :
* improve "Game Over" screen
* improve main character animations
* add interesting sound & music
* FSAA
* credit screen/intro/end
* profile and optimize where needed
 * reduce shader complexity
* compress fontdata
